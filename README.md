# Narmin02-Data-Analysis
Airline Performance Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze passenger trends, airline performance, route activity, and flight types (Non-Stop vs Connecting) across 2022–2023. The project provides actionable insights for airline strategy, route optimization, and passenger demand analysis.


## Power BI Dashboard
- Tool: Power BI
- File: Airline Performance
- Focus: Analyze airline performance and passenger trends to identify growth patterns, route efficiency, and strategic opportunities across 2022–2023.

## 📌 Short Summary

This Power BI project analyzes airline performance and passenger traffic trends for the years 2022 and 2023.
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of:

Total passenger growth and year-over-year comparison

Non-stop vs connecting passenger behavior

Airline market share with a focus on AZAL

Top airlines by flight volume

High-activity origin–destination routes

The analysis helps identify demand shifts, airline dominance, route efficiency, and passenger travel preferences. Interactive filters allow users to explore data by year, airline group, airline name, and flight type, making the dashboard suitable for both strategic and operational decision-making.

## 📊 Key Insights

Total passenger traffic increased by 8.96% from 2022 to 2023, indicating recovery and growing demand.

Non-stop passengers increased, while connecting passengers declined, showing a preference for direct flights.

AZAL holds a 4.15% market share, highlighting its role in the local aviation market.

Certain international routes (e.g. Beijing–London, Dubai–Paris) show consistently high activity.

Top airlines demonstrate a decline in total flights, despite overall passenger growth — suggesting higher load factors or route optimization.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

Increase Non-Stop Route Capacity
Passenger preference is shifting toward direct flights. Airlines should expand or prioritize high-demand non-stop routes to improve customer satisfaction and competitiveness.

Optimize Connecting Flight Networks
The decline in connecting passengers suggests inefficiencies. Airlines should reassess hub strategies and reduce low-performance transfer routes.

Strengthen AZAL’s Market Position
AZAL can increase its market share by focusing on popular international routes and improving frequency on high-traffic destinations.

Leverage High-Activity Routes for Revenue Growth
Routes with consistently high passenger volumes should be targeted for premium services, dynamic pricing, and partnership opportunities.

Use Data-Driven Capacity Planning
Despite fewer flights, passenger numbers increased. Airlines should continue optimizing aircraft utilization rather than simply increasing flight count.
